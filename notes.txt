1. First used glycan_pr.py to randomly select five percent of glycosylation sites (generates glycan_pr_5_pct.txt)

2. Then run attach_final.py to generate the cooordinates of the sugar molecules (generates glycan_5_coord.txt, glycan_5_bond.txt, glycan_5_def.txt, glycan_5_gro.txt,
 abandoned2.txt)

3. Modified glycan_5_bond.txt using rem_extra_space.py and generated glycan_5_bond_mod.txt (There was a small bug in the attach_final.py)

4. Ran write_dihedrals.py to write dihedrals (attach_final.py did not write the dihedrals, generates muc2_5_dihedral.txt)

5. Ran adjust_top.py to adjust the topology file

6. Ran adjust_gro.py to adjust the coordinate file

7. Ran make_index.py to generate the index file

Fatal error:
Step 1: The total potential energy is -nan, which is not finite. The LJ and
electrostatic contributions to the energy are 3.96411e+06 and 0, respectively.
A non-finite potential energy can be caused by overlapping interactions in
bonded interactions or very large or Nan coordinate values. Usually this is
caused by a badly- or non-equilibrated initial configuration, incorrect
interactions or parameters in the topology.

#Overcame the error by modifying code and increasing the cutoff; the cutoff for the new sugar residues were checked such
#that they do not come within (6+4)= 10 angstorm distance with any existing CA atom, nor do they come within (6+6)= 12 
#angstorm distance within any of the existing sugar bead.

#modified the make_index.py file as well, as it was not printing the 16th residue (each line has 15 residues) in each line
#there was a bug in the program. Now it is working
